ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is an effort to develop basic C++ libraries for dealing
with LIDAR (laser detection and ranging) data files, particularly
those recorded by the instruments from Raymetrics/Licel
manufactures. All code were written from scratch based on the Licel
data format:

http://www.licel.com/raw_data_format.html

________________________________________________________________________________
DISTRIBUTED FILES

*.cpp              Source code of programs and libraries
*.h                Header files of libraries
RM???????.???      Binary example files
RM???????.???.txt  ASCII example files (converted by Licel software)

HOW TO COMPILE

To compile the code you will need a working C++ compiler. If you
are not using GNU/g++, just edit the Makefile as you wish. To compile
everything at once, just:

make all

Or if you want to compile only one particular program, for example,
rm2bin, try:

make rm2bin

To clean up objects and temporary files, try:

make clean

To clean up everything, including the compiled executables:

make clean-all

If you are running on linux you should try to check the compiled programs

make check

HOW TO USE

rm2csv [list of input binary files] 

  Converts a list of binary Raymetrics/Licel files into ASCII
  files. New files are named by adding a ".csv" after each file's
  name. Data are converted to physical units. All numbers are
  separated by ";" to be read into a spreadsheet program as a
  comma-separated-values (CSV) file.

rm2dat [input binary files] 

  Converts a list of binary Raymetrics/Licel files into ASCII
  files. New files are named by adding a ".dat" after each file's
  name. Data are converted to physical units. A "# " is added to each
  header line and data is separated by tabs. The output format could
  be used easily with standard plotting utilities such as gnuplot.

rm2nc [list of input binary files] 

  Converts a list of binary Raymetrics/Licel files into netcdf
  files. New files are named by adding a ".nc" after each file's
  name. Data are converted to physical units. netCDF complies with
  COARDS conventions besides including fields such as contact and
  history. The output format could be used easily with standard
  scientific software such as grads, matlab, etc.

rm2nclist [output file] [list of input binary files] 

  Converts a list of binary Raymetrics/Licel files into a single netcdf
  file. The new file is will be <output>.nc. Data are converted to
  physical units. netCDF complies with COARDS conventions besides
  including fields such as contact and history. The output format
  could be used easily with standard scientific software such as
  grads, matlab, etc.

rm2bin [output file] [list of input binary files] 

  Adds a list of files and save the result in a binary Raymetrics/Licel
  file. The new file must not exist. Raw data and number of shoots are
  accumulated; T0 and P0 are averaged; start and end dates are set to
  be the earliest and latest amongst all files respectively, hence
  covering the whole period. All other variables, e.g. altitude,
  repetition rate, channel configuration, must be the same in all
  files.

rm2name [list of input binary files] 

  This is a very simple program that reads a list of Raymetrics/Licel
  files and, for each file, print a string to the screen with the
  following format: RM_YYYY-MM-DD_hh:mm. This could be used, for
  example, in a script that will rename the files.
